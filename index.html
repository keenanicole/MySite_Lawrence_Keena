		<h2>What is a Brony?</h2>
		
		<div class="definition">
			<p>Typically refers to 13-30 year old male fans of the 2010 reboot of the show <span>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</span>, but may also include females.</p>
			
			<p>Brony = Bro + Pony</p>
			
			<p>While generally associated with a negative stereotype by outsiders, due to it's former 80's frilly girly-girl twinkle-toed tea-parties and all-female main casting, bronies are attracted to the new show by it's good animation, acting, writing, and humor.
			
			Having once been on the outside, bronies can love and tolerate others until they themselves become bronies. However, haters gonna hateâ€” most likely due to the fact that they have a masculinity inferiority complex, where they believe that if they watched My Little Pony, others like them will label them as an effeminate freak.   </p>
			
			<p>The adult fandom has been perceived negatively by others. Media coverage of the brony phenomenon overshadowed the critical praise the show received.  The brony community has encountered ridicule through trolling on internet forums.  Kurt Schlichter of BigHollywood.com has even called the phenomenon a "terrifying new trend."  However, the adult fandom of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic has led to references to the program in popular culture, such as secret levels on Diablo III and Saturday Night Live spoofs.</p>
